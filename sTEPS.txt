1. Define Requirements
Before you start coding, clearly outline the requirements:

Course Scheduling: Allocate courses based on their total hours and credits.
Faculty Allocation: Assign faculty members to courses based on availability and specialization.
Classroom Assignment: Ensure classrooms are available and suitable for the courses.
Additional Sessions: Schedule additional sessions like labs, mentoring, and library hours.
Constraints: No faculty should be double-booked, courses should fit within available time slots, etc.
2. Gather Data
Ensure you have all necessary data:

Courses from UniqueCourses and CoursePrograms
Faculty from Faculty
Classrooms from Classrooms
Additional Sessions from AdditionalSessions
Existing Timetables (if any) to avoid conflicts
3. Design Algorithm Steps
Here's a high-level outline of the algorithm:

a. Initialize Variables
Course List: Retrieve all courses from CoursePrograms.
Faculty List: Retrieve all faculty members from Faculty.
Classroom List: Retrieve all classrooms from Classrooms.
Timetable Slots: Define time slots for each day and period.
b. Schedule Courses
Fetch Courses:
Retrieve courses for a specific program, including their total hours and credits.

Determine Time Slots:
Allocate time slots based on course requirements. For example, a course requiring 30 hours should be spread across available periods.

Assign Faculty:
For each course, assign a faculty member who is available and qualified.

Assign Classrooms:
Allocate a classroom for each course, ensuring that the classroom is available and has the required capacity.

Insert into Timetable:
Populate the Timetable table with the scheduled courses, assigned faculty, and classrooms.

c. Schedule Additional Sessions
Fetch Additional Sessions:
Retrieve additional sessions like labs, mentoring, and library from AdditionalSessions.

Assign Time Slots:
Allocate time slots for each additional session, ensuring that they do not conflict with regular classes.

Assign Faculty and Classrooms:
Assign faculty members and classrooms to additional sessions as needed.

Insert into Timetable:
Populate the Timetable table with additional sessions.

d. Conflict Resolution
Check for Conflicts: Ensure no faculty member is double-booked and classrooms are not over-allocated.
Adjust Schedule: If conflicts are found, adjust the schedule and reassign time slots as necessary.
4. Implement Algorithm
Hereâ€™s a basic pseudocode example for the algorithm:

python
Copy code
# Pseudocode Example
def generate_timetable(program_id):
    courses = get_courses_for_program(program_id)
    faculty = get_all_faculty()
    classrooms = get_all_classrooms()
    timetable_slots = define_timetable_slots()

    for course in courses:
        for week in range(course.total_hours / weekly_hours):
            day, period = find_available_slot()
            assigned_faculty = assign_faculty(course)
            assigned_classroom = assign_classroom()
            insert_into_timetable(program_id, day, period, course, assigned_faculty, assigned_classroom)

    additional_sessions = get_additional_sessions_for_program(program_id)
    for session in additional_sessions:
        day, period = find_available_slot()
        assigned_faculty = assign_faculty_for_session(session)
        assigned_classroom = assign_classroom_for_session()
        insert_into_timetable(program_id, day, period, session, assigned_faculty, assigned_classroom)

    resolve_conflicts()

def find_available_slot():
    # Logic to find an available day and period for a course or session
    pass

def assign_faculty(course):
    # Logic to assign a faculty member to a course
    pass

def assign_classroom():
    # Logic to assign a classroom to a course or session
    pass

def resolve_conflicts():
    # Logic to resolve any conflicts in the timetable
    pass
5. Testing and Refinement
Test the Algorithm: Use sample data to ensure the algorithm generates valid timetables.
Refine as Needed: Adjust the algorithm based on testing results to handle edge cases and improve efficiency.
6. Integrate with GUI
Interface: Create a GUI to interact with the algorithm, allowing users to trigger timetable generation and view results.
